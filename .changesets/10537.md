- fix(mw): Make invokeOptions a non-optional type (#10537) by @dac09

When a middleware is executed (inside invoke), we _always_ pass options, even if the middleware function itself is can be undefined (if the middleware router doesn't match anything). 

In order to do this, I had to change how middleware is invoked (use an object instead of parameters), because `options` is a required parameter following an optional parameter `middleware`

```js
// before
const [mwRes] = await invoke(req, middleware, options)

// after
const [mwRes] = await invoke({req, middleware, options})
```
