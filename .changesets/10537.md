- fix(mw): Make invokeOptions a non-optional type (#10537) by @dac09

The invokeOptions is always supplied when invoking middleware, but may not always be used. 

In order to do this, I had to change how middleware is invoked (use an object instead of parameters)

```js
// before
const [mwRes] = await invoke(req, middleware, options)

// after
const [mwRes] = await invoke({req, middleware, options})
```
